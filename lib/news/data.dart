          "Jude Bellingham and Levi Colwill withdrew from the England squad after they sat out games for Real Madrid and Chelsea respectively with shoulder problems, so who will step up and seize their opportunity to impress Gareth Southgate in Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia?\n\nWhy Southgate will take Malta and North Macedonia seriously\n\nEngland are home and dry as far as Euro 2024 qualification is concerned - but do not expect Gareth Southgate to start experimenting with his line-up in these final two group games.\n\nThat's because England still have work to do in order to secure place in Pot 1 of the group stage draw, meaning a more favourable set of opponents in Germany next summer.\nFor England to qualify as top seeds, they need to finish top of their group and in the top five teams across the European qualifiers for most points picked up in their group.\n\nSouthgate's side currently have the fourth-highest number of points - and need a win and a draw to secure a Pot 1 place on their own terms. Victory over Malta on Friday and other results going their way could also be enough.\nSo England still have something to play for as this qualification campaign comes to a close - expect Southgate to go strong over the next week.",

      description:
          "As 16-year-old Jamal Bhuyan woke from a coma, in his mind, it was still Friday, November 17, 2006. He had a game on Saturday for FC Copenhagen’s youth team and needed to tell the coach that he wouldn’t be available.\n\nRather than passing him the phone, the nurse handed him a newspaper. It was now Sunday, and splashed across the pages of the paper was none other than Bhuyan himself.\n\nBhuyan was shot four times, one bullet narrowly missing his heart, after he was caught in the crossfire of gang-related gunfire in the suburbs of the Danish capital. He was lucky to still be alive.\n\nThen a promising footballer in the youth side of one of Denmark’s biggest clubs and on the verge of breaking into the senior team, that fateful Friday afternoon stopped his fledgling career in its tracks.\n\nHe spent four lonely months in hospital during an arduous recovery process.\nDespite undergoing 12 surgeries and still suffering from the effects of the shooting – he has limited feeling and movement in his right hand – being a footballer was his dream and he refused to walk away.\n\n",

          "Even the biggest British football fans can probably be forgiven for not knowing the name Harun Hamid.\n\nThe 19-year-old was released by English second-tier side QPR at the end of last season and currently doesn't play for a professional side.\n\nBut just last month Harun's name was on the lips of millions of people in Pakistan when he scored the biggest goal in their World Cup qualifying history.\n\nHis goal was enough to beat Cambodia 1-0 for their first win in five years - putting them through to the second round of qualifying for football's biggest tournament for the first time.\n\nPakistan's reward for the win is their highest-profile game to date, a match against Saudi Arabia - the only team to beat World Cup winners Argentina at last winter's tournament - at 16:30 GMT on Thursday.\n\nWe're playing against the team that beat Messi's Argentina and we don't even have a pro league - Harun says\n\nPakistan has the fifth largest population in the world with about 240 million people, but its football team is ranked a lowly 193rd - one place below the island of Aruba and two above the Seychelles.\n\nThe fact that it does not have its own professional league, as Harun says, is one of the key reasons that British Pakistani players like him are being called up to play for the national team under dual nationality rules.",
